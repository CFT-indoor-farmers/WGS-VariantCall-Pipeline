# Multithreaded mode
# To split ADMIXTUREâ€™s work among N threads, you may append the flag -jN (e.g. -j4) to your ADMIXTURE command. 
# The core algorithms will run up to N times as fast, presuming you have at least N processors.

# Section 2.1: choosing the correct value for K using cross validation, then use this K value for actual analysis

# Define directories

# Admixture will output files in the current working directory.
# PLEASE USE DIFFERENT OUTPUT DIRECTORIES FOR DIFFERENT VEGETABLES/CROPS, AS ADMIXTURE WILL OVERWRITE OLD FILES
# DUE TO DEFAULT NAMING SYSTEM.

# Cross-validation to determine the "optimal K value"
# Additionally, perform P and Q matrix calculation for K=2 to K=9 example.
